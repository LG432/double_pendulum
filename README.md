# Double Pendulum Simulation in Python

This project simulates and visualises the **double pendulum** system by solving a system of ODEs derived from **Lagrangian mechanics**.

## Background
The double pendulum system is a system of two pendulums attached end to end. Its dynamics are described by a set of coupled, non-linear differential equations that are derived from Lagrangian mechanics. The system depends heavily on the intial conditions set.

## Features

- Sets up the variables of the problem using SymPy and Numpy
- Solves the equations of motion using SymPy and Scipy
- Animates the motion with Matplotlib


## Result
