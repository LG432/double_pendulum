# Double Pendulum Simulation in Python

This project simulates and visualises the **double pendulum** system by solving a system of ODEs derived from **Lagrangian mechanics**.

## Features

- Sets up the variables of the problem using SymPy and Numpy
- Solves the equations of motion using SymPy and Scipy
- Animates the motion with Matplotlib


## Result
